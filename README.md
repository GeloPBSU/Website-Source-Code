This portfolio includes a simple built-in chatbot created using vanilla JavaScript. It listens for the Enter key event in a text input field and checks the user's question for keywords like "skills", "projects", "resume", or "education". Based on the detected keyword, it provides a pre-defined response simulating a basic conversation. The chatbot dynamically adds user and bot messages to a scrollable log using DOM manipulation, offering an interactive way to explore key parts of the site.
